# Aaron's User Page

## **Introduction**

**Hello!** My name is ***Aaron Chao***, and I'm currently a third year *Computer Science* transfer from Irvine, California. I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois for 2 years, then moved to California where I have stayed ever since. At home I have a beagle named ***Cody*** and my family loves him very much, no matter how much he howls and begs for food. When I have time I like to play some tennis or videogames with friends. I'm not too sure what field I want to go into yet for computer science but I'm hoping to get a better understanding of software engineering as a whole with this class!
